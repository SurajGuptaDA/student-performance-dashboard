## 👥 Demographics Analysis
This section explores the background distribution of students.

**Analysis Focus:**<br>

**Student distribution by Percentage Achieved in 10<sup>th</sup>/12<sup>th</sup>**<br>

This Distribution dipicts that:
  
- consistent high performance: Whole Distribution follows a uniform distribution instead of having a Normal distribution(bell curve) and students are likely to score 95% as much likely for them to score 70%.
- Mojority of the Students are b/w 55% to 95%, acheiving a very healthy score portion.
- Normally Students Scored 55% and highest possible score of students is 95% and there is dip in scores in the middle resulting 60% is the least common score b/w students.

This Distribution dipicts that:
  
- Trend of Decline at the end: This distribution is more common to what we usualy find in scores distribution emerging as slightly positive skewed distribution ensuring achieving high score is more difficult.
-  Similar to previous Distribution, 55% is the Normally Achieved score within students and 95% is the highest achieved score.
-  Stablity of mid-Ranges Suggests that average performance are broad range plateau.
